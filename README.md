# ManualSoftwareTester-Portofolio

# About me
My name is Afifuddin. I am an aspiring Junior Software Tester with a background in Informatics Engineering and a strong interest in software quality assurance. I have recently focused my career development on software testing, a field that has genuinely interested me for a long time, and I am eager to apply and further develop my skills in a professional environment.

I strongly believe that high-quality software is a key factor in delivering reliable and valuable products. Through online testing courses and hands-on practice, I have gained experience in manual testing, including test case creation, test scenario design, and bug reporting using industry-standard tools. I am detail-oriented, analytical, and committed to ensuring software functions as expected from a user’s perspective.

In addition to my technical skills, I have developed strong communication, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities, which help me collaborate effectively with different stakeholders. I am highly motivated to continuously learn and improve, and I am currently seeking a Junior Software Tester / QA position where I can contribute my skills while growing professionally in the field of software testing.
